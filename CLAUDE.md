# CLAUDE.md — notes for the assistant

The library of ActivityTrack on the PC (client, vault, update check), used by the cli, the tui and the desktop application. Work in progress lives in the GitLab issues and merge requests.

## 0. Branches and releases (read first)

The whole workflow is in
[activitytrack-doc/agents/workflow.md](https://gitlab.com/activitytrack/activitytrack-doc/-/blob/main/agents/workflow.md)
(usually cloned next to this repository as `../activitytrack-doc`). In short:

- `main` is the **last released version**, `next` is the development branch. Work happens
  in `feature/<name>` or `issue/<n>-<name>`, cut from `next` and merged back into it with a
  merge request. Nobody pushes to `main` or `next`.
- Stable release: merge request `next` → `main`, merged fast-forward only; tag `vX.Y.Z` on
  `main`; then merge `main` into `next`.
- Beta: tag `vX.Y.Z-beta-N` on `next` (X.Y.Z is the *next* version); Debian version
  `X.Y.Z~betaN-1`. Needs the unit tests and the local Wine jobs, not the paid Windows pipeline.
- Security patch: `security/<name>` cut from `main`, version `X.Y.Z.1`, released at once with
  the security report, then merged into `next`.
- Test locally first. Pipelines on GitLab's shared runners start only when the owner says so;
  jobs with `tags: [local]` run on the owner's runner (see `agents/local-ci.md` in the
  documentation repository).
- The Android application id, the AppStream ids and the package names keep the
  `it.infraconsulting` names; they do not follow the GitLab group.

## 1. Working rules

- English for code, comments, commits and docs; Italian with the maintainer.
- Indentation as the surrounding code. No secrets, tokens or personal data in the repository: it is public.
- Commits end with the `Co-Authored-By:` line naming the model actually used.

## 2. Tests

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
```
The job `windows` of `.gitlab-ci.yml` runs the same tests on Windows (paid shared runner, on command).

## 3. A release touches

- `activitytrack/__init__.py` (version), `debian/changelog` (`X.Y.Z-1`; a beta is `X.Y.Z~betaN-1`).
- The tag `vX.Y.Z` is what the cli, tui and desktop name in `.gitlab/lib-ref`: release the library **first**.
